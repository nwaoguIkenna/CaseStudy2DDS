# CaseStudy

### Executive Summary

      In this case study, we examine employment attrition and how it relates to other variables from a dataset provided by DDS Analytics was analyzed in the first part of this case study. We have also analyzed how these variables relate to the monthly income. We specifically looked at variables like, Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Stock Options, Marital Status and so on in other to predict the outcome of Attrition. We also used the above variables like Attrition, Job Level, Years At Company, Years In Current Role etc to predict the outcome of Monthly income.

### Description

     DDSAnalytics is an analytics company that specializes in talent management solutions for Fortune 100 companies. Talent management is defined as the iterative process of developing and retaining employees. It may include workforce planning, employee training programs, identifying high-potential employees and reducing/preventing voluntary employee turnover (attrition). To gain a competitive edge over its competition, DDSAnalytics is planning to leverage data science for talent management. The executive leadership has identified predicting employee turnover as its first application of data science for talent management. Before the business green lights the project, we are tasked to conduct an analysis of existing employee data.

    They provided us with a dataset named CaseStudy2-data.csv. Our goal is to analyze the data and identify factors that lead to attrition. We were to identify the top three factors that contribute to turnover backed up by evidence provided by our analysis. DDSAnalytics are also interested in learning about any job role specific trends that may exist in the data set. They also wanted us to build a model to predict attrition. We utilized the Naive Bayes theorem for our model. Experiments and analysis was conducted in R. 

    We also analyzed the relationships between Monthly income and other variables and build a model that would predict Monthly Income. We used feature selection package called Boruta for our feature selection analysis for both models. We used regression for building our model to predict Monthly Income.


### Take Aways

We analyzed at dataset for employment attrition and how it relates to other variables in the dataset; we have also analyzed how some of these variables relate to the monthly income. 
We need more data, for our classification because there were much more No than Yes. 
There were about 15-20 important variables for classification and 12 for regression model. There were less for regression.

We achieved the goals set for our classification and regression models.
